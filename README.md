# Mini Message Board

The Mini Message Board is a basic web application built with Node.js, Express, and EJS that allows users to post and view messages. The main page displays a list of all messages, while a simple form located at /new enables users to submit new messages. Upon submission, the new message is added to the list and displayed on the main page. This project demonstrates the fundamental use of Express routing, handling GET and POST requests, and rendering dynamic content with EJS templates
